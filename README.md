# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for this project was to make it easier for students to see all of their notes in one place. I built this project so that bootcamp students can see all of thier information in one place rather than flipping through pages of the bootcamp. It eliminates the problem of seperating notes and gives easier access to students. Solving the problem of having to flip through pages or lessons. Through this project I learned how to create an html page and link it to both a CSS file and a JavaScript file.
